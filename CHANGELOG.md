# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- Root folder ID resolution now uses Overleaf's collaboration socket payload as authoritative source, fixing `push` failures (`folder_not_found`) for projects where HTML parsing and ObjectID arithmetic both return incorrect IDs ([#1](https://github.com/aloth/olcli/pull/1))
- `uploadFile()` now auto-retries once with a refreshed root folder ID when receiving `folder_not_found`

### Improved
- E2E tests are now portable across projects (configurable project name, no `main.tex` assumption, optional `.bbl` check)
- Added regression test for stale cached `rootFolderId`
